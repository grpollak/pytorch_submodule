        Is a module that contains a collection of stateless functions intended for neural network operations without learnable parameters that do not change
        the way the operate between training and inference.
        But this module may also be used to build more complex custom neural network layers.
        This may include activation/loss functions, normalization, pooling layers and so on:
        \begin{mintlinebox}{python}
            import torch.nn.functional as F

            t = torch.randn(1, 1, 4, 4)
            output = F.interpolate(t, scale_factor=2, mode='bilinear')
        \end{mintlinebox}
    \end{defn}
